# hello-world
A salutation and introduction the world of coding.

Hello! 
My name is Aaron and I have an irrational obsession with birds.
This isn't an exaggeration. 
I will drive hundreds of miles to look for a single individual of a species I haven't seen.
An individual that can fly. 
Insanity.
But I'm happy.
Insanely happy.
